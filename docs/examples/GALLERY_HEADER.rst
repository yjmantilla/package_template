Examples
========

This gallery showcases example scripts demonstrating how to use this package in common scenarios.

Each example is a self-contained Python script that can be viewed in the documentation and executed locally.

Tips
----
- Read the narrative text above each code block for context and explanations.
- Click the "Download" links on example pages to obtain the source files.
- To run an example locally, ensure the package and optional dependencies are installed.

Install the docs dependencies (which include plotting backends) with:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m pip install -e '.[docs]'

Then run a script, for example from the repository root:

.. code-block:: bash

   python docs/examples/plot_basic.py
