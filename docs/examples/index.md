# Example gallery

Welcome to the example gallery for `package_template`.

Each example script whose filename starts with `plot_` will be executed by Sphinx-Gallery to generate figures and rich HTML output. Use these examples to learn common usage patterns and best practices.

You can run the examples locally by executing the scripts in `docs/examples/` with your environment active. The rendered versions will appear in the documentation under the "Examples" section.
